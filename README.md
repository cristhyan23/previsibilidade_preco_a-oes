# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

This project utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict stock prices for the next week. The LSTM model is trained on historical stock data obtained from Yahoo Finance.

## Overview

The main objective of this project is to forecast the future prices of various stocks by training a deep learning model using LSTM. The predicted prices are then analyzed to provide insights into potential growth trends.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following Python libraries:

- `yfinance`: For retrieving stock data from Yahoo Finance.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `tensorflow` and `keras`: For implementing the LSTM model.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `scikit-learn`: For preprocessing data and evaluating model performance.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following components:

1. **Data Retrieval**: Stock data is fetched from Yahoo Finance for a specified period.
2. **Data Preparation**: The fetched data is preprocessed and prepared to be fed into the LSTM model.
3. **Model Training**: A sequential LSTM model is defined and trained using the prepared data.
4. **Prediction**: The trained model is used to predict stock prices for the next week.
5. **Analysis**: The predicted prices are analyzed to determine growth trends and model accuracy.
6. **Output**: The results, including predictions and analysis, are saved in an Excel file.

## Usage

To use this project:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed (`yfinance`, `numpy`, `tensorflow`, `keras`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`).
2. Run the script `stock_price_prediction.py`.
3. The script will generate predictions for the specified stocks and save the results in an Excel file named `predictions.xlsx`.

## Note

- This project is intended for educational and experimental purposes only.
- Stock price prediction is inherently uncertain and influenced by various factors. Results may not always be accurate or reliable.
- It's recommended to consult with financial experts before making any investment decisions based on the predictions generated by this project.
